# Introduction {.fixed-box}

In this tutorial, we will assess Goodness-of-Fit via the coefficient of determination. 

### Load data and estimate model

For this tutorial, we will be using the `food` data from PoE that can be found at http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/poe5data.html. To make it easier to access this data, I have set up a shortened URL: http://tiny.cc/poe
-data. Thus, to load `food.csv` into R, use the following URL: http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv. We use the following code to load the data and estimate the model we will use in this tutorial.

```{r, echo=T, results='hide'}
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)
```

## Explanition

The coefficient of determination,  $R^2$, is defined as the proportion of the variance in  $y$  that is explained by the regression and the total variation in  $y$. $R^2$ is displayed in the model summary and is labeled "Multiple R-squared" (see bellow).

```{r, echo=T}
summary(mod1)
```

## You try

Regress `food_exp` on `income` and store the model in a object named `mod1`. Then use the summary function to determine $R^2$.


```{r tut=T, ex="EstModEX", type="sample-code"}
# load data into an object called food


# Regress `food_exp` on `income` and store the model in a object named `mod1`


# display a summary of the model

```

```{r tut=T, ex="EstModEX", type="solution"}
# load data into an object called food
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))

# Regress `food_exp` on `income` and store the model in a object named `mod1`
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)

# display a summary of the model
summary(mod1)
```

```{r tut=T, ex="EstModEX", type="sct"}

ex() %>% check_output_expr("summary(mod1)")
success_msg(praise("${Exclamation}! You did a ${adjective} job!"))

```

# Warning about $R^2$ {.tabset .fixed-height}

## Explanition

$R^2$ is neither the only measure of goodness-of-fit nor is it a sufficient measure. It is a usefully statistic, but it has it limitations. One of those limitations is that $R^2$ is increasing in the number of parameters in the model. So if you add an independent variable, $R^2$ will go up. Adjusted $R^2$ attempts to fix this by adding a penalty for adding lees statistical significant independent variables. As a result, adjusted $R^2$ is not a measure of goodness-of-fit, but rather a model selection criteria, but it is not a very good one.

Moreover, $R^2$ is not a substitute for plotting the data as was shown a statistion named  

```{r}
data("anscombe")
describe(anscombe, skew = F,ranges = F)
```

### Anscombe's Quartet Ploted

```{r echo=F}
p1 <- anscombe %>% ggplot(aes(x=x1,y=y1)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Plot 1") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

p2 <- anscombe %>% ggplot(aes(x=x2,y=y2)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Plot 2") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

p3 <- anscombe %>% ggplot(aes(x=x3,y=y3)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Plot 3") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

p4 <- anscombe %>% ggplot(aes(x=x4,y=y4)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("Plot 4") +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

multiplot(p1, p2, p3, p4, cols=2)

```




# Summary of all code {.fixed-box}

```{r echo = T, eval=F, tut=F}
# Code

## Load Data
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))

## Estimate Model
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)

## Summarize model
summary(mod1)

```
