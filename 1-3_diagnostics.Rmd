# Introduction {.fixed-box}

In this tutorial, we will evaluate basic residual diagnostics of a model. 

### Load data and estimate model

For this tutorial, we will be using the `food` data from PoE that can be found at http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/poe5data.html. To make it easier to access this data, I have set up a shortened URL: http://tiny.cc/poe-data/. Thus, to load `food.csv` into R, use the following URL: http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv. We use the following code to load the data and estimate the model we will use in this tutorial.

```{r, echo=T, results='hide'}
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)
```

# Fitted and residual values {.tabset .fixed-height}

## Explanition

After estimating a model, the fitted values and the residuals can be accessed via the `$`. The model object contains several components. In R, the components within an object can be accessed by appending a dollar sign, `$`, and the name of the component. Thus the following code stores fitted values, i.e. $\hat{y}$, and the residues, $e$.

```{r echo=TRUE}
fitted <- mod1$fitted.values
resid <- mod1$residuals
```

### Actual vs Fitted Plot

Now, lets plot the actual vs fitted values of the dependent variable. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(x=food$food_exp,y=mod1$fitted.values)
abline(0,1)
```

In this plot, the closer each point is to the solid line, the closer $\hat{y}$ is to $y$. The above figure suggests a non-linear relationship, but more on that in the next tutorial.


### "Perfect" fitted and residual values

Here is an example of a actual vs fitted plot that is nearly optimal. The data has been simulated to meet all the assumptions of linear regression.

```{r echo=F}
x <- runif(250,1,10)
y <- 5 + 2.5*x + rnorm(250,0,2)
mod2 <- lm(y~x)

plot(y=mod2$fitted.values,x=y)
abline(0,1)
```

::: {.info-box .note}
This plot is nearly ideal because the points form an even band above and below the $\hat{y}=y$ line.
:::

## You try

`mod1` has already been estimated. Use the `$` notation to access the fitted and actual values of fodd expenditure and then use the `plot()` and `abline()` function to draw an actual vs fitted plot.

```{r tut=T, ex="FitActualEX", type="pre-exercise-code"}
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)
```

```{r tut=T, ex="FitActualEX", type="sample-code"}
# 

```

```{r tut=T, ex="FitActualEX", type="solution"}
plot(x=food$food_exp,y=mod1$fitted.values)
abline(0,1)
```

## Explanition

One of the best diagnostic plots is the residuals vs. fit plot. You can draw the residuals vs. fit plot with the `plot()` function. But a much more attractive plot can be obtained using ggplot2, which is a part of the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a group, or "ecosystem" of R packages for cleaning and visualizing data. To use the tidyverse package, we need to install and load the package. 

The following code chunk test weather the tidyverse has been installed, installs the package if needed, and then loads the package. `install.packages()` command installs the package and the `library()` command loads the package. For now, you can copy this code and paste this code to use it in your own analysis.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F, results='hide'}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
  suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

I have written a function, `plot.fitted()`, that you can copy an past into you analysis. You simply pass the linear model you estimated to it. Thus, for `mod`, you can use the following code to draw the residual vs. fit plot. 

```{r echo=T}
plot.fitted(mod1)
```

::: {.info-box .note}
Notice the funnel shape of the scatter plot. This is further evidence that a linear model is not the best for this data.

### "Perfect" Residuals vs. Fit Plot

Here is an example of a residuals vs. fit plot that is nearly optimal. The data has been simulated to meet all the assumptions of linear regression.

```{r}
plot.fitted(mod2)
```

## Residual Plot Function

The following function takes the linear model object as an input and draws the residuals vs. fit plot. Do not worry if this function looks too complicated. Yo can simply cut and past it into your work.

```{r, echo=T,results='hide'}
plot.fitted <- function(lmod) {
  df = lmod$model
  title = paste("Residuals vs. Fits (Dependent Variable: ",
                names(df)[1],
                ")",
                sep = "")
  pr <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x = fitted(lmod), y = resid(lmod))) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = -sigma(lmod), ymax = sigma(lmod)),
                fill = "gray",
                alpha = .5) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = -sigma(lmod)*2, ymax = sigma(lmod)*2),
                fill = "lightgray",
                alpha = .5) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_classic() +
    ggtitle(title) +
    ylab("Residules") +
    xlab("Fitted") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
               linetype = "solid",
               color = "black")
  return(pr)
}
```

## You try

```{r tut=T, ex="FitResidEX", type="pre-exercise-code"}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
plot.fitted <- function(lmod) {
  df = lmod$model
  title = paste("Residuals vs. Fits (Dependent Variable: ",
                names(df)[1],
                ")",
                sep = "")
  pr <- df %>% ggplot(aes(x = fitted(lmod), y = resid(lmod))) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = -sigma(lmod), ymax = sigma(lmod)),
                fill = "gray",
                alpha = .5) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = -sigma(lmod)*2, ymax = sigma(lmod)*2),
                fill = "lightgray",
                alpha = .5) +

               linetype = "solid",
               color = "black")
  return(pr)
}
food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)
```


```{r tut=T, ex="FitResidEX", type="sample-code"}
# Use plot.fitted() to draw a residuals vs. fitted plot for mod1 

```

```{r tut=T, ex="FitResidEX", type="solution"}
plot.fitted(mod1)
```

## Explanition

The residuals from the regression model should have an approximately normal distribution. Linear regression is rather robust to violations of this assumption, so it is sufficient to examine a histogram of the residuals. I have written a function for you `plot.normal()` that draws a histogram of the residuals with a normal curve superimposed. The histogram of the residuals for the food expenditure model doesn't look too bad. 

```{r}
plot.normal(mod1)
```

### "Perfect" Residuals Histogram

Here is an example of a histogram of the residuals that is nearly optimal. The data has been simulated to meet all the assumptions of linear regression.

```{r}
plot.normal(mod2)
```


## Normal Plot Function

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
plot.normal <- function(lmod) {
  res <- resid(lmod)
  hist(res, probability = T)
  curve(
    dnorm(x, mean = mean(res), sd = (sd(res))),
    col = "darkblue",
    lwd = 2,
    add = TRUE,
    yaxt = "n"
  )
}
```

  res <- resid(lmod)
  hist(res, probability = T)
  curve(
    dnorm(x, mean = mean(res), sd = (sd(res))),
    col = "darkblue",
    lwd = 2,
    add = TRUE,
    yaxt = "n"
  )

food <- read.csv(url("http://tiny.cc/poe-data/food.csv"))
mod1 <- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)
```


```{r tut=T, ex="ResidNormEX", type="sample-code"}
# Use plot.normal() to draw a residuals vs. fitted plot for mod1 

```

```{r tut=T, ex="ResidNormEX", type="solution"}
plot.normal(mod1)
```
